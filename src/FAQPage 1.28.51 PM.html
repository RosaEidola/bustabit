                                <li><a href="sHkhkd" style=color:white>The house margin is scaled between 0 and 1 %, depending on how long you hold. An additional 1 % is effectively taken from every bet and put into the bankroll which is distributed in its entirety every game. As a consequence, skilless or random play has—at worst—an expected return of -2 %, but it is possible to overcome the house margin.The numbers are baked into the game, so you never need to worry about it. We do not have a fixed house margin, as this would prevent highly conservative play (e.g. If you were only attempting to make $2 in a $100 game, a house margin of 1 % would be 50 % of your potential profits!). Our unique formula makes it fair for both highly conservative play (cash out early) and highly aggressive play (hold until you're a millionaire). All games are fair.
                                </li>

                                <li><a href="sHkhkd" style=color:white>1 % * (intendedCashOut - roomAmount) * (roomAmount / intendedCashOut). Use our odds calculator on the game page to get a better sense. First, it mixes the hash with the clientSeed (decided by the provably fair seeding event) using hmac-sha256
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Secondly it gives a 1 in 101 chance of instant busting
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Third, it works out what the multiplier would be if there was no
                                    house edge.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Fourth, it takes 1% off the multiplier and adds on 0.01x:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So half the time (other than 0x bust which we can ignore because
                                    they pay for themselves with the bonus) the multiplier will be 1.99x
                                    or more.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That means if we bet 1.99x we have a 50% chance of winning (again,
                                    ignoring 0x busts), and so the house edge is: 100 - (1.99 * 50) = 100 - 99.5 = 0.5%</code>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The extra 0.01 that gets added on to the multiplier is half of the 1%
                                    that was taken off in this case, leaving the house edge at 0.5%. As
                                    the multiplier gets bigger, the 1% that is taken off gets bigger, and
                                    the 0.01x that gets added on becomes less and less significant,
                                    causing the house edge to tend to 1%</li>
